Pheromone Distribution: Heat maps showing pheromone concentration across the network
Convergence Analysis: Charts tracking solution quality improvement over iterations
Traffic Impact Analysis: Visual comparison of routes with and without traffic consideration

🧪 Algorithm Details
ACO-Route implements a variant of the Ant Colony System (ACS) algorithm with the following characteristics:

Pheromone Deposition: Ants deposit pheromones inversely proportional to route length
Stochastic Path Selection: Probabilistic next-node selection based on pheromone levels and heuristic information
Local Search: Implementation of local optimization techniques to refine solutions
Parallel Processing: Utilizes multi-threading for concurrent ant colony simulations
Traffic Integration: Traffic conditions dynamically affect the desirability of route segments

🛠️ Advanced Configuration
Configuration options are available in config.json to fine-tune algorithm behavior:

alpha: Weight of pheromone values (default: 1.0)
beta: Weight of heuristic information (default: 2.0)
evaporation_rate: Pheromone evaporation coefficient (default: 0.1)
iterations: Number of algorithm iterations (default: 100)
ant_count: Number of ants per iteration (default: 20)
traffic_influence: How strongly traffic affects routing (default: 0.7)
